The index.html is the file for the home page of the Monster Hunter Notebook website.
This shows a few random monsters of both small and large size.

Next is the items and monsters tabs.
These are a list of all the available Items and Monsters in Monster Hunter World.
There are displayed in a table like format, with a heading for neatness.

Then there is the locales, all of the available locations in game.
This will also show some of the available camps with their corresponding zone number.

Lastly is the contact page, a typical page used to get in contact with me via email.

There is also the style.css for styling the pages.
And finally is the .js javascript file.
This is there as I will be using a javascript plugin for the Monster Hunter information.
